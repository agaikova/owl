# Owl
This is (supposedly) a model of an owl prism experiment published in Letters To Nature 
(you can read about the whole thing [here](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v419/n6904/full/nature01002.html))

The scope of this model is substantially smaller than the scope of the paper -  it only takes into account
tuning curve shifts when a large single step visual distortion is introduced to adult barn owls.
